# matchr/img

An approximate image matching library for the [Go Programming Language](https://www.golang.org).

## Rationale

### Metrics to be Implemented

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
Universal Quality Image Index (UQI)
Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index(MS-SSIM)
Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthese (ERGAS))
Spatial Correlation Coefficient (SCC)
Relative Average Specral Error (RASE)
Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM)
Spectral Distortion Index (D\_LAMBDA)
Spatial Distortion Index (D\_S)
Quality with No Reference (QNR)
Visual Information Fidelity (VIF)
Block Sensitive - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR-B)

Average Hashing (aHash)
Perceptual Hashing (pHash)
Difference Hashing (dHash)
Wavelet Hashing (wHash)
HSV Color Hashing (colorHash)
Crop-Resistant Hashing (crHash)
PDQ Perceptual Hashing (PDQ)

## Credit

Inspiration comes from the pythonic image quality metrics library [sewar](https://pypi.org/project/sewar). The same metrics implemented by sewar will be implemented here, with more to follow including image hashing/distance algorithms.

This is a personal project, though I hope that someone finds some use from it.

/bin/bash: wq: command not found

Will add links to all research papers used throughout the creation of this library.
